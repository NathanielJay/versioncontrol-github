# Collaborating With Conflict

If you and your group have any questions, or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1.  If you haven’t already, please work through the _Version Control with GitHub #1 Workshop - Getting Started_ handout -and- _GitHub #2 Workshop - Collaborating._
2.  Let’s create a conflict in the index.html file so that we can later resolve it:
    -   In your Atom editor change the 2nd line of code to: `<h1>My Test GitHub Document Too</h1>`
    -   Save and then in GitHub Desktop commit the change under the Changes tab.
    -   In Github Desktop, click on the **Current Branch** tab on the top navigation bar, and then select **master / main**. If you were watching your Atom editor as you selected **master / main**, you would have seen the text in the **index.html** file change as you switched from the **goats** branch, back to the **master / main** trunk.
    -   Back in your Atom editor change the 2nd line of code in index.html to: `<h1>My Test GitHub Document 2</h1>`
    -   Save and then in GitHub Desktop “commit the change” you just made.
    -   Now push those changes to **master / main** trunk to the GitHub website by pressing the “Push origin” button at the top of GitHub Desktop.
    -   Next click on the **Current Branch** tab on the top nav bar, and select **goats**. Push the change to the **goat** branch to the GitHub website by selecting **Push origin**.
    -   We just created a conflict in the **index.html** file between both the **master** and **goats**.
3.  Let’s resolve the conflict now:
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
4.  Let’s bring up the network map of the changes you’ve made in your repository.
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
5.  Congratulations! You’ve successfully resolved a conflict in GitHub Desktop!
